Scraper for the significant commitments of interest of professors at the University of Zurich (Interessenbindung)
=================================================================================================================

The University of Zurich publishes the [significant commitments of interest of its professors on its website](https://www.uzh.ch/prof/ssl-dir/interessenbindungen/client/web/) to make it transparent and accessible for everyone.
With this scraper, the data is even machine readable and can be analyzed further and even combined with other data.

Maybe in the future the University of Zurich decides to publish the data in a machine readable form, until then this scraper is here to help close this gap.

The scraper runs on [morph.io](https://morph.io/metaodi/uzh-commitments-scraper) where you can either download the data as CSV or SQLite or [access it via the API](https://morph.io/documentation/api?scraper=metaodi%2Fuzh-commitments-scraper).
