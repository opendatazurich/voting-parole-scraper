Scraper for the voting paroles for Zurichs communal votes
==========================================================

This is data from [the website of the Stadtkanzlei of the City of Zurich](https://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/portal/de/index/politik_u_recht/abstimmungen_u_wahlen.html).
They collect the voting paroles for the communal votes some weeks prior to the vote.

This scraper runs on [morph.io](https://morph.io/opendatazurich/voting-parole-scraper), where you can either download the data as CSV or SQLite database or access it via the API.
